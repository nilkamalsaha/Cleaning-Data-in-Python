# Cleaning-Data-in-Python

Hi There,

We just finished collecting survey data from a few thousand customers who've purchased our alarm clocks (see attached).
Can you read the data into Python and make sure the data type of each column makes sense? We'd like to do quite a few calculations using the data, so if a column can be converted to a numeric or datetime column. please do so. 

Thanks Alan

### Assignments: Cleaning Data
1. Data in Python Request
- Read in data from the Excel spreadsheet (Alarm Survey Data.xlsx) and put into a Pandas DataFrame
- Check the data type of each column
- Convert object columns into numeric or datetime columns, as needed

2. Missing Data Check
- Find any missing data
- Deal with the missing data

3. Inconsistent Text & Typos Check
   
- Find any inconsistent text and typos
- Deal with the inconsistent text and typos

4. Duplicate Data Check

- Find any duplicate data
- Deal with the duplicate data

5. Outliers Check

- Find any outliers
- Deal with the outliers

6. Data Issues Check
   
- Quickly explore the updated DataFrame. How do things look now after handling the data issues compared to the original DataFrame

7. Create Columns From Numeric Data
- Read data into Python
- Check the data type of each column
- Create a numeric column using arithmetic
- Create a numeric column using conditional logic

Hints:

**Create a “Total Spend” column that includes both the pen cost and shipping cost for each sale

**Create a “Free Shipping” column that says yes if the sale included free shipping, and no otherwise

8. Create Columns From DateTime Data
- Calculate the difference between two datetime columns and save it as a new column
- Take the average of a column

Hints:

** Calculate the number of days between the purchase and delivery date for each sale

** Save it as a new column called “Delivery Time”

** What were the average days from purchase to delivery?
